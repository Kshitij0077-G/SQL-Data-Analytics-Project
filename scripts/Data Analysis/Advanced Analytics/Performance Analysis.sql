===============================================================================
Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================

Comparing the current value to a target value. 
Helps measure success and compare performance

Current[Measure] - Target[Measure]

Purpose:
    - To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track yearly trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.
